This is my Graduate Capstone Project for Wuhan University.  
This application is developed in Chrome and some features require Chrome to work correctly.

## Features
* Built components from sratch
* State management with React.js only
* SCSS and Canvas Animations
* Typescript Best Practice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### \`npm start\`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### \`npm test\`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### \`npm run build\`

Builds the app for production to the \`build\` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### \`npm run eject\`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you \`eject\`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can \`eject\` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except \`eject\` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use \`eject\`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a \`<script>\` tag in one minute.
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a \`<script>\` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a \`react\` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/).  

Check out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)
* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

\`\`\`jsx
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
\`\`\`

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a \`<script>\` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.

## Building

In order to build the TypeScript compiler, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript.git
\`\`\`

Change to the TypeScript directory:

\`\`\`bash
cd TypeScript
\`\`\`

Install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) tools and dev dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g gulp
npm ci
\`\`\`

Use one of the following to build and test:

\`\`\`
gulp local             # Build the compiler into built/local.
gulp clean             # Delete the built compiler.
gulp LKG               # Replace the last known good with the built one.
                       # Bootstrapping step to be executed when the built compiler reaches a stable state.
gulp tests             # Build the test infrastructure using the built compiler.
gulp runtests          # Run tests using the built compiler and test infrastructure.
                       # You can override the specific suite runner used or specify a test for this command.
                       # Use --tests=<testPath> for a specific test and/or --runner=<runnerName> for a specific suite.
                       # Valid runners include conformance, compiler, fourslash, project, user, and docker
                       # The user and docker runners are extended test suite runners - the user runner
                       # works on disk in the tests/cases/user directory, while the docker runner works in containers.
                       # You'll need to have the docker executable in your system path for the docker runner to work.
gulp runtests-parallel # Like runtests, but split across multiple threads. Uses a number of threads equal to the system
                       # core count by default. Use --workers=<number> to adjust this.
gulp baseline-accept   # This replaces the baseline test results with the results obtained from gulp runtests.
gulp lint              # Runs eslint on the TypeScript source.
gulp help              # List the above commands.
\`\`\`


## Usage

\`\`\`bash
node built/local/tsc.js hello.ts
\`\`\`

**Sass makes CSS fun again**. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules,
variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It's translated to
well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a plugin for your
build system.

\`\`\`scss
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}

@mixin border-radius($radius) {
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
     -moz-border-radius: $radius;
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;
          border-radius: $radius;
}

nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { @include border-radius(10px); }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Install Sass

You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for
your operating system [from GitHub][] and [adding it to your \`PATH\`][PATH].
That's all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to
install.

[from GitHub]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases
[PATH]: https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/

If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using [npm][] by running

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

\`\`\`
npm install -g sass
\`\`\`

**However, please note** that this will install the pure JavaScript
implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed
here. But it has the same interface, so it'll be easy to swap in another
implementation later if you need a bit more speed!

See [the Sass website](https://sass-lang.com/install) for more ways to install
Sass.

Once you have Sass installed, you can run the \`sass\` executable to compile
\`.sass\` and \`.scss\` files to \`.css\` files. For example:

\`\`\`
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
\`\`\`

## Learn Sass

Check out [the Sass website](https://sass-lang.com/guide) for a guide on how to
learn Sass!

## This Repository

This repository isn't an implementation of Sass. Those live in
[\`sass/dart-sass\`][] and [\`sass/libsass\`][]. Instead, it contains:

[\`sass/dart-sass\`]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass
[\`sass/libsass\`]: https://github.com/sass/libsass

* [\`spec/\`][], which contains specifications for language features.
* [\`proposal/\`][], which contains in-progress proposals for changes to the
  language.
* [\`accepted/\`][], which contains proposals that have been accepted and are
  either implemented or in the process of being implemented.

[\`spec/\`]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/spec
[\`proposal/\`]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/proposal
[\`accepted/\`]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/accepted

Note that this doesn't contain a full specification of Sass. Instead, feature
specifications are written as needed when a new feature is being designed or
when an implementor needs additional clarity about how something is supposed to
work. This means many of the specs in \`spec/\` only cover small portions of the
features in question.

### Versioning Policy

The proposals in this repository are versioned, to make it easy to track changes
over time and to refer to older versions. Every version has a Git tag of the
form \`proposal.<name>.draft-<version>\`. A new version should be created for each
batch of changes.

Every version has a major version, and they may have a minor version as well
(indicated \`<major>.<minor>\`). The minor version should be incremented for
changes that don't affect the intended semantics of the proposal; otherwise, the
major version should be incremented.`;
